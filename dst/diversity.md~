I was first introduced to investigative journalism through a 2021 partnership with the Ida B.
Wells Society for Investigative Reporting.
I published this article under the mentorship of a local journalist.
This project sparked my commitment to diversity and love of investigative journalism.

Inspired by my investigative piece a year prior, I decided to use my 2022 project to continue my advocacy work.
I researched an old rundown mall right outside of downtown and learned how it exemplified Durham’s gentrification.
After completing this article, I asked my bilingual classmates to [translate it into Spanish](https://thepirateshook.com/2023/02/07/cuando-el-destino-de-northgate-se-fue-al-sur/) so it could reach a wider audience.

    <h3>OPINION</h3>
    <h1>Northgate’s future must be about affordable housing not profit<h1>
    <p>Located in the heart of Durham, Northgate mall has always served as a social hub. But as developers plan to tear down the mall and build offices in its place, everyone has their own idea of how the property should be used.</p>
