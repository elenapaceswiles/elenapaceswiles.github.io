    <h3>OPINION</h3>
    <h1>Fights, scandal, allegiances: high school or city council?</h1>
    <p>From an alleged punch thrown to a campaign scandal to inflammatory speeches, it’s shocking that Durham’s City Council finds time to get anything done at all.</p>

<p>When the Hook was invited to send representatives to a local political forum, I jumped at the opportunity.
I have been interested in politics for as long as I can remember and am the board&#8217;s secretary for the local chapter of the progressive democratic party.
By attending this event, I hoped to learn more about the candidates my group endorsed.
But due to my personal involvement, I was worried about a conflict of interests.
Under my advisor’s encouragement, I leaned into my personal feelings to write a well-informed opinion piece on local politics.
After this article was published, I received feedback from a local journalist.
She suggested that I alter some of my phrasing, such as adding “alleged” in my lead, to ensure my piece was factually accurate.
This taught me the value of fact-checking and peer feedback.</p>

    <h1>Meet CLAUDE, the “multitalented” service dog</h1>
    <p>For Spanish teacher Elizabeth Wagner, a service dog is a gateway to independence, but its positive impacts extend throughout the whole school community.</p>

</a></p>
<p>This was one of the first stories I wrote for the Hook.
I began the project with limited journalism experience.
Covering this story was the first time I realized that journalism could help me connect with my school community.
Although I did not know Ms. Wagner before the article, I enjoyed learning about her and her service dog’s positive impact on her students.
After the story was published, Ms.Wagner reached out to us and let us know that we had misspelled “CLAUDE,” instead using lowercase letters.
While this was the first time I received corrections to my work, it definitely was not the last.
This article won second place for feature stories in a 2022 NCSMA contest.</p>
