<p>I am the co-editor-in-chief for the Pirates’ Hook, Riverside’s bilingual student newspaper.
I am a passionate writer and find great joy in editing student work.</p>
<p>Each year, my favorite project is my semester-long investigative feature.
My classmates and I ask hard questions which turn into impactful stories about our school and community.
When I was a sophomore, The Pirates’ Hook partnered with the <a href="https://idabwellssociety.org/">Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting</a>, a news trade organization dedicated to increasing and retaining reporters and editors of color in the field of investigative reporting.
The Hook was selected by the organization to pilot a program that extends its training, mentorship and support to high school students.</p>
<p>
As a member of a diverse student body, I also believe that all students should be able to access our coverage, including the families who speak a language other than English at home.
Spanish is the most commonly spoken language among our ESL students, so we translate a portion of our content both in print and online.
It requires more time, space on the page, student collaboration and review by a bilingual faculty advisor, but it’s worth it because news should be accessible to everyone.
</p>
<p>
Although I do not plan to major in journalism next year, I will use my writing and investigation skills to research psychology and write for my school paper.
