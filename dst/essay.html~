<p>&#8220;Where were all the ladies?&#8221; </p>
<p>I had just stepped off Epcot&#8217;s Spaceship Earth ride.
From cave paintings to the rise and fall of Rome to the first computers, the ride showcased human achievement throughout history, but one significant thing was missing: of all the historic characters, only a few were women.
I was four years old, the only one in my family who noticed, and already asking hard questions.</p>
<p>Twelve years later I noticed a different kind of inequality.
When I scanned the room in my sophomore AP US history class, a sea of white faces met my eyes.
Only a handful of kids in the class were students of color despite Black and Latino students making up 68% of the school.
I decided to find out why.</p>
<p>I have always had one ear to the ground, observing and searching for ways to make the world better.
Asking questions has always come naturally to me.
Ever since I was a kid, I have been able to pinpoint injustices.
But until I joined my school paper, I had no idea how to inspire change.</p>

<p>In 2021 The Pirates’ Hook partnered with the Ida B.
Wells Society for Investigative Reporting, a program that paired journalism students with local reporters.
My mentor not only helped me become a better writer, but also pushed me to ask difficult questions in pursuit of the truth.
Inspired by the program’s namesake, Ida B.
Wells, a 19th-century journalist and advocate for racial and gender justice, I formulated a step-by-step plan to shed light on the lack of representation in advanced classes.</p>
<p>Step one: find a good source.
I sent out a survey to AP teachers to distribute to their students.
A Black sophomore boy in my history class responded to my survey and agreed to an interview.
After speaking with him, I knew his story had to be at the forefront of my article.
He told me that despite being at the top of the class and excelling in AP courses, he was not always awarded these opportunities.
He was confined to standard classes until his parents fought for his schedule to change in middle school.</p>
<p>Step two: follow the story.
The more I researched, the deeper the inequalities seemed to be, and they started way before high school.
I dug into the process of how schools identified  Academically and Intellectually Gifted (AIG) students.
I spoke with district-level employees and elementary AIG teachers to learn how a Durham Public Schools initiative was attempting to address this inequity.
I learned that tracking down sources takes time, patience, and persistence.
But, my desire to tell the story won out over my frustration.</p>
<p>Step three: evaluate the success of the initiative.
Some barriers, such as excluding students from advanced opportunities due to behavioral infractions, have been lifted.
However, standardized tests continue to be used for AIG identification despite the evidence that they are biased against students of color.
Extrapolating from this data, I realized that while some progress was made towards equity, there is still a long way to go.
While district leaders spoke about visions of equity and inclusion, my classrooms didn’t reflect this sentiment.</p>
<p>Step four: showcase the findings.
After a semester of research and interviews, I published my piece.
 Although I gathered quotes, information, and interviews from seven sources, it took some time to figure out how to tell the story.
Although this topic was vast, I only had 1500 words.
I decided to use a narrative format, highlighting Jackson’s story and explaining the role of early opportunities on later success.</p>
<p>This work strengthened my understanding of marginalized communities.
Although I was aware of racism in my community, I did not fully understand the systemic nature of the issue.
Talking directly to people of color opened my eyes to others’ experiences.
I learned that racism is ingrained in our education system.</p>
<p>This project also taught me that my voice holds power.
For the first time, I not only noticed inequities but I was able to develop a concrete plan to promote awareness.</p>
<p>Inspired by this realization, I wrote another investigative piece on gentrification in Durham through an exploration of the Northgate Mall property.
I researched the history of the mall and the surrounding neighborhood in order to understand the impact of the property’s development on Durham residents.
I then collaborated with a bilingual classmate to publish a Spanish version of the story.
After spending months researching the complexities of this topic for my investigative story, I developed my own ideas and wrote an opinion column about the issue.
My column was picked up by the Triangle Tribune, a newspaper that serves the local Black community.</p>
<p>When reproductive rights began to be threatened in North Carolina, I knew I wanted to dig into the issue.
I felt called again to investigative journalism.
Eager to learn more, I spoke with healthcare workers, students and faculty, and advocates on both sides of the issue.
My research accumulated in a 2,500-word story on the bill’s effect on the school community.
I also collaborated with a bilingual classmate to publish a Spanish version of the story.
I plan to publish an opinion piece on the topic as well.</p>
<p>Through these projects, I found a way to advocate by giving a voice to marginalized communities and sharing stories that are often left untold.
But true advocacy is about more than diverse topics and perspectives.
We must also ensure our community members have equal access to our content.
Riverside is 38.8 percent Latino and English-as-a-Second-Language students make up 21% of the total population, presenting a unique challenge to the Hook’s mission to be a news resource for the entire school.
To my knowledge, the Hook is the only bilingual high school newspaper in the state, making it even more important that we are intentional about informing the community.</p>
<p>As the Head Writing Editor of the Pirates’ Hook, I revise practically every piece we publish and determine what the school community needs to know.
My role as editor includes determining which stories to translate.
Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have the resources to publish our entire issue in both English and Spanish, so we must work together as a staff to determine which stories are most relevant to Spanish-speaking students and families.</p>
<p>Just like the girl who wore her hair in pigtails and stood barely three feet tall, when I think about the future I dream of real change.
Through student journalism I&#8217;ve learned how to transform this dream into reality.
My time at the Hook will stay with me forever, inspiring me to continue fighting for equity and advocating through writing wherever I go.</p>
