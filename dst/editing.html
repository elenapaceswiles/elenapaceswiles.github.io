<p>News spread quickly on a Thursday in November as students heard rumors of a gun on campus.
Since many local media sources were already covering the incident, the Hook decided to write an editorial about our thoughts.
We gathered opinions from the entire staff via a google form.
Along with my co-editors, I assisted a new staff-member in drafting this piece.
After she completed her draft, I edited it to ensure we thoroughly covered this divisive topic.</p>

<p>I helped a new newspaper student publish this article on our schoolâ€™s marine science club.
Although he was inexperienced and unfamiliar with many stylistic and grammar rules, he was eager to learn.
I enjoyed editing his writing and assisting him in transforming his draft into his first ever story.</p>
