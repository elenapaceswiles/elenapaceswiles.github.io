<p>When social studies teacher Abigail Wood was named Beginning Teacher of the Year, I knew we had to get the information out to the Riverside community before the school district issued their press release.
I decided to cover her recognition as a broadcast.</p>

<p>I had to step out of my comfort zone since I had never done a broadcast before.
I learned a lot about dealing with the audio challenges of being on site at the school, video framing and editing.</p>
