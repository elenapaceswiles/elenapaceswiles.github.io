    <h3>OPINION</h3>
    <h1>Fights, scandal, allegiances: high school or city council?</h1>
    <p>From an alleged punch thrown to a campaign scandal to inflammatory speeches, it’s shocking that Durham’s City Council finds time to get anything done at all.</p>

<p>When the Hook was invited to send representatives to a local political forum, I jumped at the opportunity.
I have been interested in politics for as long as I can remember and am the board's secretary for the local chapter of the progressive democratic party.
By attending this event, I hoped to learn more about the candidates my group endorsed.
But due to my personal involvement, I was worried about a conflict of interests.
Under my advisor’s encouragement, I leaned into my personal feelings to write a well-informed opinion piece on local politics.
After this article was published, I received feedback from a local journalist.
She suggested that I alter some of my phrasing, such as adding “alleged” in my lead, to ensure my piece was factually accurate.
This taught me the value of fact-checking and peer feedback.</p>

    <p>Ogres are like onions: they have a lot of layers.
And Riverside’s production of Shrek: the Musical does, too.</p>

<p>After weeks of interviews, I understood a part of the school I had previously never been involved in.
I knew very little about the theater department prior to this assignment.
But by speaking to the actors, dancers, directors, tech crew members and the musical ensemble, I learned that a lot of work goes into every performance.
By covering the musical, I was able to educate myself and share what I learned with our readers.
I hoped to follow this article up with a review of the performance, but I was unable to attend.</p>

    <h1>Annual orchestra concert honors students who have passed</h1>
    <p>Music filled the Riverside auditorium on Friday night for the seventh-annual Ailyn Maldonado Scholarship Benefit Concert.</p>

<p>I already planned to attend this event since my friend was performing the viola, so I took the opportunity when my advisor proposed the story.
But after talking to Ms.
Moore, I learned the concert was much more than just beautiful music.
This was one of the first articles I wrote about a sensitive topic and I wanted to make sure every detail was correct.I hope that by writing this article, I raised awareness for the department’s fundraising efforts and shared the stories of students we have lost.
Additionally, I had a very short turn-around time for this piece since I wanted it published soon after the concert.
Although I am proud of this article, I hope to be more descriptive in my description if I attend a similar event in the future since many of the Hook’s readers do not generally attend culture arts performances.</p>

    <h1>Meet CLAUDE, the “multitalented” service dog</h1>
    <p>For Spanish teacher Elizabeth Wagner, a service dog is a gateway to independence, but its positive impacts extend throughout the whole school community.</p>
  </div>
</div>
</a>
<p>This was one of the first stories I wrote for the Hook.
I began the project with limited journalism experience.
Covering this story was the first time I realized that journalism could help me connect with my school community.
Although I did not know Ms.
Wagner before the article, I enjoyed learning about her and her service dog’s positive impact on her students.
After the story was published, Ms.
Wagner reached out to us and let us know that we had misspelled “CLAUDE,” instead using lowercase letters.
While this was the first time I received corrections to my work, it definitely was not the last.
This article won second place for feature stories in a 2022 NCSMA contest.</p>
