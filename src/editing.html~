<p>While I spend a lot of time editing student drafts, I am involved in every part of the process. I help students with everything from first steps to sourcing. My co-editors and I select topics, assign stories and decide what visuals to use.</p>

<p>News spread quickly on a Thursday in November as students heard rumors of a gun on campus.
Since many local media sources were already covering the incident, the Hook decided to write an editorial about our thoughts.
We gathered opinions from the entire staff via a google form.
Along with my co-editors, I assisted a new staff-member in drafting this piece.
After she completed her draft, I edited it to ensure we thoroughly covered this divisive topic.</p>

    <h3>OPINION</h3>
    <h1>It’s time to talk about the gun</h1>
    <p>Last Thursday, November 30, Hook students’ phones started buzzing near the end of second period. When searching a student’s backpack for a vape, school resource officers (SROs) found a loaded gun.</p>

<p>I helped a new newspaper student publish this article on our school’s marine science club.
Although he was inexperienced and unfamiliar with many stylistic and grammar rules, he was eager to learn.
I enjoyed editing his writing and assisting him in transforming his draft into his first ever story.</p>

<p>While I had my own 2023 investigative project, I also assisted my peers in finishing theirs.
Since I had already written similar articles in the past, I was able to suggest possible next steps in addition to providing grammatical feedback.
