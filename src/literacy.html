    <h1>Murder or Healthcare?</h1>
    <p>It depends who you ask.
Regardless, prospective mothers have less time to decide.</p>

<p>Although I had two semesters of experience writing investigative stories, this one challenged my own bias the most.
Prior to writing this article, I had my own beliefs about abortion and was fairly knowledgeable on the issue.
I live in a liberal area and the vast majority of my school community is pro-choice.
While my research taught me more about the side I was already familiar with, the most valuable part of the experience was learning from those on the other side.
Through this process, I was forced to venture outside of my comfort zone and reach out to dozens of churches and pro-life organizations in the hope someone would speak with me.
By including these sources, I was able to balance the perspectives I already had. Since I felt like this was such an important topic, I asked my bilingual classmates to translate my article, so it could reach the whole school.</p>

    <h1>When Northgate’s fate went south</h1>
    <p>As a historic mall sits empty, developers and residents debate its future.</p>

<p>Inspired by my investigative piece a year prior, I decided to use my 2022 project to continue pushing for change.
I researched an old rundown mall right outside of downtown and learned how it exemplified Durham’s gentrification.
This story required me to reconsider my preconceived beliefs.
Although I had my own opinions on the property, I spoke with property developers, community members, and city council-members to eliminate bias.
After completing this article, I asked my bilingual classmates to <a href="https://thepirateshook.com/2023/02/07/cuando-el-destino-de-northgate-se-fue-al-sur/">translate it into Spanish</a> so it could reach a wider audience.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to investigative journalism through a 2021 partnership with the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting.
I published this article under the mentorship of a local journalist.
This project sparked my commitment to diversity and love of investigative journalism.
It required me to ask difficult questions and ask not just “what?” but “why?” I ensured I understood all sides of the story by learning from district employees in addition to elementary teachers and my peers’ personal experiences.</p>
