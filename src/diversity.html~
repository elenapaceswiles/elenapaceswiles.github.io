<p>Inspired by my investigative piece a year prior, I decided to use my 2022 project to continue my advocacy work.
I researched an old rundown mall right outside of downtown and learned how it exemplified Durham’s gentrification.
After completing this article, I asked my bilingual classmates to <a href="https://thepirateshook.com/2023/02/07/cuando-el-destino-de-northgate-se-fue-al-sur/">translate it into Spanish</a> so it could reach a wider audience.</p>

    <h1>Northgate’s future must be about affordable housing not profit</h1>
    <p>Located in the heart of Durham, Northgate mall has always served as a social hub.
    But as developers plan to tear down the mall and build offices in its place, everyone has their own idea of how the property should be used.</p>

<p>After publishing my Northgate article, I decided to publish an opinion piece.
I used the knowledge I gained to inform my own idea for the space.
This article was picked up by the Triangle Tribune, a local paper which serves Durham’s Black community.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to investigative journalism through a 2021 partnership with the Ida B.
Wells Society for Investigative Reporting.
I published this article under the mentorship of a local journalist.
This project sparked my commitment to diversity and love of investigative journalism.</p>
